                <AccordionContent>
                  The Fashion Independent is a crowdfunding platform designed specifically for independent fashion
                  designers. We help talented designers bring their creative visions to life by connecting them with
                  backers who appreciate unique, sustainable fashion.

                <AccordionTrigger>How does the crowdfunding process work?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Designers launch campaigns with a funding goal and timeline (typically 30 days). Backers pledge money
                  to support campaigns they love. If a campaign reaches its minimum pledge requirement (10 backers),
                  it's successful and the designer receives the funds to produce the items.

                <AccordionTrigger>What happens if a campaign doesn't reach its goal?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  If a campaign doesn't receive at least 10 pledges (excluding luxury/handmade items), backers are not
                  charged and the campaign is not funded. This ensures designers only move forward when there's
                  sufficient interest.

                <AccordionTrigger>How long does delivery take?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Standard campaigns have 60 days to deliver after successful funding. Designers using our manufacturing
                  services typically deliver within 7-30 days. Luxury/handmade items have up to 90 days for delivery.

                <AccordionContent>
                  ShapeMe Body Modeler is our beta feature that creates a 3D representation of your body shape for
                  automatic sizing. This helps ensure better-fitting garments and reduces returns. It's completely
                  optional and your data is kept private.

                <AccordionTrigger>Can I cancel my pledge?</AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent>
                  Yes, you can cancel your pledge at any time before the campaign ends. Once a campaign successfully
                  ends and payment processing begins, pledges cannot be cancelled.
