            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By accessing and using The Fashion Independent platform, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and
              provision of this agreement.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Use License</h2>
            <p>
              Permission is granted to temporarily access the materials on The Fashion Independent's website for
              personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only.
            </p>

            <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>
              When you create an account with us, you must provide accurate, complete, and current information. Failure
              to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Crowdfunding Terms</h2>
            <p>
              Backers understand that pledging to a campaign is not a purchase but a contribution to help bring a
              creative project to life. Designers are responsible for fulfilling their campaign promises.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>
              Payment processing takes 10 business days after a campaign successfully ends. Funds are deposited to the
              designer's account minus applicable service fees.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>
              Designers retain ownership of their designs and intellectual property. By launching a campaign, designers
              grant The Fashion Independent a license to display and promote their work on the platform.
            </p>

            <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
            <p>
              Users may not use the platform for any illegal purposes or to violate any laws. Fraudulent campaigns,
              counterfeit goods, and misleading information are strictly prohibited.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
              The Fashion Independent is not liable for any disputes between backers and designers. We provide the
              platform but do not guarantee campaign success or product delivery.
            </p>

            <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>
              We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes
              constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
            </p>

            <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
            <p>For questions about these Terms, please contact us through our support channels.</p>
